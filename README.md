  ## Description
 For this challenge, a node.js command-line application is built that inputs information about particular employees on a software engineering team and creates a HTML webpage displaying summaries for each individual and their position.
  ## Languages
  JavaScript, HTML, CSS, OOP (Object Oriented Programming), TDD (Test-Driven Development), Node/NPM, Inquirer, and Jest were used for this challenge.
  ## Installation
  On the Github repository, click on the "Code" button to then copy the link. To clone the repository, input in the command-line, "git clone [paste link here]." Then input "npm init" to install the Node Package Manager. Additionally, use the command "npm install inquirer" to obtain the npm's inquirer package. Input into the command-line "npm install jest --save-dev". Make sure "jest" is within the test value in the package.json.
  ## Usage
  Ensure the software is downloaded and the node packages are initialized. Within the directory for this project, initialize the prompts using the command "node index.js". Answer and input the text following the information provided within the terminal. A new HTML file will be created thereafter!

  ## Contributing
  Users may make pull requests, submit bugs or feature requests within the updated code if there is something that could be improved for this challenge.
  ## Tests
  The Employee test file will assess the generation of the new employee.
  The Manager, Intern, and Engineer test files will test the gathered data and functions to generate a new employee, which are extended from the Employee file, along with their corresponding characteristics and methods. 
  In the terminal, use the command line and input, "npm run test [file name]" to test a specific file, or utilize "npm run test" to run all of the tests.
